This is a long-term wish list of things I would change on the next rewrite of ADHydro.

3) More generic framework for stateful third-party physics modules

E-T state and GARTO state are pretty ad-hoc and hard-coded.  GARTO state with its struct of dynamically allocated arrays presented a lot of problems for pupping and storing in NetCDF files.  Figure out a good generic design for this.

5) Better build system

The current build process is pretty fractured and without any automatic configuration system.

6) Harmonize input file names

Some files got named .soilType, .landCover, and .geolType.  To match the form of other files they should really be .soil, .veg, and .geol.  Also, the .geolType file just has a 0/1 bit flag for whether it's alluvial.  That's all we are using right now, but if we put the full geology type in the file it will be easier to use other information if we decide we want to in the future.
